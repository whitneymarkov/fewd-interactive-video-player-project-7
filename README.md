# fewd-interactive-video-player-project-7
Build an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API.

Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, 
build an interactive video player that synchronises the 
video and the transcript. The transcript should be placed 
below the video, and should highlight as the video progresses. 
When a user clicks any part of the transcript it should take 
them to the appropriate place in the video.
